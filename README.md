# confusion-Restaurant

# To quickly run the app 
- cd to json-server then open a terminal and write 'json-server --watch db.json'

# Detials
- the real code and development is done in confusion/app folder 
- then after you are done editting the code you get out of the app folder to the confusion folder and write the command 'gulp'
- by that command you minify/ugligy..etc your files and put the results files in the dist folder 
- update your sever by copying all the file in the dist folder to the json-server/public folder

# note
 - when tracing an error don't do it on the server caz all the JS files are now merged in one files, maybe you can run the        index.html , that is inside the app folder on Firefox and start tracing the error!  

# Requirments 
  Nodejs, npm,gulp and bower
